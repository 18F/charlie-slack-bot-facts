    "This is Piglet :dag-piglet:. She's a rescue American Pit Bull Terrier hailing from the Central Valley of California, now living mostly in an orange chair in SF. She loves sitting on people, booping things with her nose, and disguising herself as a land seal. Her person is Christa. https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C035CQWNA/p1632865698043600",
