  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the command `off the bed, please` - the “please” is an integral part of that request and she doesn’t think you’re serious unless/until you include it",
  ":belle-belle: Belle has also realized that in many cases, when we ask her `off the bed, please` that she actually just needs to be off the _top_ of the covers so we can straighten them, and has the option to go under covers instead, so now she always tries that first",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the word `walk` in about six different languages before we just started slipping the letter `W` into conversation without any special intonation and divorcing it from the actual question to Belle of `wanna go outside!?` (duh, YES)",
  ":belle-belle: Belle loves `shake` and `other shake` - the more excited she is, the harder and faster she slaps your hand",
  ":belle-belle: Belle has an outdoor pen she can let herself into that includes a pond and dog loungers. When it's warm out, she goes into the pond after every walk. She suns herself outside sometimes, but always on the same side so her hairless pink under-Belle-y turns gray only on one half",
  ":belle-belle: Belle likes boops, so whenever someone holds out a finger, she’ll reach out and boop her nose against it",
  ":belle-belle: Belle loves fluffy blankets, long walks, going “under covers” (and later having to “snorkel” to stick her face out once she overheats), and her Jolly ball",
  ":belle-belle: Belle will stand on/near you and kiss you forever if you allow it, until you tell her `enough!` She doesn't understand why you think you've had enough puppy kisses, but she respects your choice",
  ":belle-belle: Once, when Belle was being boarded, she discovered that she could throw the tasty-food-stuffed bone on the concrete floors and break it open. Ever since then, she occasionally tries this at home on the wood floors just in case it will work. It is ineffective but loud. Her method is to throw the bone up in the air and then quickly dart out of the way of it landing",
  ":belle-belle: Belle occasionally enjoys chasing her tail but if she sees you looking at her while she does it she suddenly remembers a scrap of dignity and stops",
  ":belle-belle: In the summer, Belle's immediate post-walk routine is to jump in her pond for a quick cool-off! She'll bring duckweed and a surprising amount of water inside if not toweled off afterwards",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the command `snorkle!` She'll crawl out at least far enough from under covers to stick her nose out because she's overheating",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the command `come be friends` - she'll come snuggle or lay next to me!",
  ":belle-belle: Belle once ate an entire bag of green candy melts and had green :poop: for a couple days",
  ":belle-belle: Belle visited a local river park wearing her harness and a 30ft lead, and we walked out on a floating dock. She apparently thought the duckweed was just a new kind of grass, so she walked straight off the end! She looked SO surprised when she came back up, then started swimming around the dock. When we stopped laughing too hard, we were able to catch her harness handle and haul her out of the water, completely drenched and with little bits of duckweed all over her like green glitter.",
