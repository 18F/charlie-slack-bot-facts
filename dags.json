  ":belle-dag: Belle loves sunbeams more than anything except belly rubs and bacon.",
  ":belle-dag: Belle likes to have her nails painted. She holds out her paw to have it done, then wants to show everyone how they look when they're done.",
  ":belle-dag: Belle can't see or hear all that well anymore. She relies on her well-honed sniffer.",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the command `off the bed, please` - the “please” is an integral part of that request and she doesn’t think you’re serious unless/until you include it",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the word `walk` in about six different languages before we just started slipping the letter `W` into conversation without any special intonation and divorcing it from the actual question to Belle of `wanna go outside!?` (duh, YES)",
  ":belle-belle: Belle loves `shake` and `other shake` - the more excited she is, the harder and faster she slaps your hand",
  ":belle-belle: Belle has an outdoor pen she can let herself into that includes a pond and dog loungers. When it's warm out, she goes into the pond after every walk. She suns herself outside sometimes, but always on the same side so her hairless pink under-Belle-y turns gray only on one half",
  ":belle-belle: Belle likes boops, so whenever someone holds out a finger, she’ll reach out and boop her nose against it",
  ":belle-belle: Belle loves fluffy blankets, long walks, going “under covers” (and later having to “snorkel” to stick her face out once she overheats), and her Jolly ball",
  ":belle-belle: Belle will stand on/near you and kiss you forever if you allow it, until you tell her `enough!` She doesn't understand why you think you've had enough puppy kisses, but she respects your choice",
  ":belle-belle: Once, when Belle was being boarded, she discovered that she could throw the tasty-food-stuffed bone on the concrete floors and break it open. Ever since then, she occasionally tries this at home on the wood floors just in case it will work. It is ineffective but loud. Her method is to throw the bone up in the air and then quickly dart out of the way of it landing",
  ":belle-belle: Belle occasionally enjoys chasing her tail but if she sees you looking at her while she does it she suddenly remembers a scrap of dignity and stops",
  ":belle-belle: In the summer, Belle's immediate post-walk routine is to jump in her pond for a quick cool-off! She'll bring duckweed and a surprising amount of water inside if not toweled off afterwards",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the command `snorkle!` She'll crawl out at least far enough from under covers to stick her nose out because she's overheating",
  ":belle-belle: Belle knows the command `come be friends` - she'll come snuggle or lay next to me!",
  ":belle-belle: Belle once ate an entire bag of green candy melts and had green :poop: for a couple days",
  ":bubba: Bubba used to be scared of walking down the stairs, so Kate and Micah had to carry him downstairs each day.",
  ":bubba: Bubba’s favorite food is cottage cheese.",
  ":bubba: On walks, Bubba is easily intimidated — he’s typically scared of garbage cans and upturned paper grocery bags.",
  ":bubba: Bubba was originally going to be named “Tater Tot” (but Bubba was a better fit).",
  ":cooper: Cooper will not eat peanuts or peanut butter.",
  ":cooper: Cooper's full name is Wilford J Cooperbottom.",
  ":cooper: Cooper only likes two toys: his laser and destroying whatever toy Cupcake had a minute ago.",
  ":cooper: One day Cooper was paying too much attention to another dog and he walked right into a parked car.",
  ":cooper: Every winter we have to rub dryer sheets on Cooper or else he gets shocked every time someone touches him. He gets very careful about touching anyone.",
  ":cooper: When we go to the dog park, Cooper likes to show off on the agility dog ramps. We never trained him to do the ramps, he just saw other dogs on them and he likes to one-up other dogs.",
  ":cooper: If you give :cooper: Cooper and :cupcake-dag: Cupcake a toy they will remember. When you come to visit months later they will go to the toybox and get it out to show you that they still have it.",
  ":cooper: Cooper doesn't really understand \"staining the deck,\" so he stuck his face between two balusters and ended up with dark brown stripes on either side of his head. :disappointed:",
  ":cupcake-dag: Cupcake does not like hats. At all.",
  ":cupcake-dag: Cupcake's full name is Princess Petunia Cupcake.",
  ":cupcake-dag: Cupcake likes to nap on the back of the couch.",
  ":cupcake-dag: Cupcake can roll down car windows, but she won't do it for Cooper.",
  ":cupcake-dag: Cupcake often sits on Carter's shoulders",
  ":fox-dag: Fox and Luna are 18F dog twins.",
  ":fox-dag: Fox's favorite food is smoked salmon. She's fancy like that.",
  ":fox-dag: Fox once barked at a picture of a dog in a magazine.",
  ":fox-dag: Fox was Miss September in the 2018 Pike Paws calendar. She now goes around the house saying things like \"I won't get out of bed for less than $10,000/day.\"",
  ":hugo: Hugo is named after Hugo Cabret, the literary child abandoned to raise himself in the infrastructure of a railway station, on account of his being abandoned by his prior owners.",
  ":hugo: Hugo can be convinced to crawl under a bed from one side to the other when amped up.",
  ":hugo: Hugo will do a somersault on command, but only in front of the bedroom closet where he originally learned the trick.",
  ":hugo: Hugo is terrified of humans wearing headbands with springy things on them, even if they are people he knows well.",
  ":laddie-dag: Laddie is scared of his own farts.",
  ":loki: Loki will give you the stare of death if you do not share an apple with him.",
  ":loki: Loki’s tongue is physically too large for his own mouth and just hangs out all day.",
  ":loki: Loki once ate an entire bag of Reese’s peanut butter cups, wrappers and all. He had sparkly :poop: for a week!",
  ":loki: Loki once decided it was a good idea to roll around in cow patties and run up to us like it was no big deal.",
  ":loki: Loki was named after the Nordic god of tricks and mischief, which fits his personality perfectly.",
  ":mahalo_goldeneye: Mahalo raced in Daytona Beach, Florida.",
  ":mason: Mason's favorite toy is a folded in tennis ball that he chews on like bubble gum.",
  ":zoey: Zoey's favorite game is \"where's your ball?\" The way the game works is that she'll be on the porch, and I'll hide her ball somewhere in the room when she can't see and then she sniffs around to find where it's hidden.",
  ":neko: Jessie dropped an apple once, and Neko grabbed it like a ball and went running around the house to show it off.",
  ":neko: Neko is part rottweiler, part pit bull, and part chow chow, which is the best and weirdest and most surprising thing.",
  ":paloma: Paloma looks a little like Toto from The Wizard of Oz. She dislikes the car but loves riding in a bike basket, which inspires lots of \"TOTO!\" calls as she rides through town.",
  ":paloma: Paloma knows how to ring a bell on command. But, she never quite caught onto the fact that ringing the bell would alert her parents to take her outside, so now it's just a fun party trick.",
  ":paloma: According to Wisdom Panel, Paloma is a lhasapoouhuahua (lhasa apso / poodle / chihuahua mix). Because Paloma's mom is embarrassed to admit she DNA tested her dog, she tells people she's simply a \"terrier mix.\"",
  ":paloma: When Paloma meets someone new, she begs for a belly rub. If she knows you already, she also begs for a belly rub. It's her standard greeting (unless you're a delivery driver...).",
  ":pancho-dag: Pancho can read.",
  ":pancho-dag: Pancho is not color blind, he knows UPS brown.",
