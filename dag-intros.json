  "This is Winry. She is a mini Australian shepherd, though she is technically too big to qualify as a mini Aussie and still too small to be a standard Aussie. She loves vegetables and playing fetch or tug. Her person is Greg. https://i.imgur.com/2FIVmLI.jpg",
  "This is Ripley. She's a rescue and is a pit bull and probably some other stuff too. She's about 45 pounds and likes to spend all day completely buried under blankets. Her person is Mike, but her one true love is: food. https://gsa.enterprise.slack.com/files/U01J98DCLKV/F02LX3ZSH6E/26941d30-7460-4bb4-bb40-d567031ad764.jpg",
  "This is Ruby. The rescue says she's part corgi and part Pomeranian, but couldn't say how old she is. She loves playing keep-away and barking at anyone on the sidewalk. Her person is Anne. https://gsa.enterprise.slack.com/files/U01J7MC3ZH9/FDACVGBRR/chinrest.jpeg",
  "This is Copper! He is a red heeler mix and just the cutest little toasted marshmallow coo-coo there ever was. His hobbies are cuddling, chasing squirrels, jumping fences, and sleeping on his back. His owner Eleni mistakenly believed that Copper was a foster dog initially, but Copper set her straight. https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C035CQWNA/p1636577099227700",
  "This is Teddy. He's a rescue from a place called Fresno, which I'm told exists somewhere in California. He's part catahoula, part border collie, and part velociraptor. He's widely recognized for his skill at standing on things. https://brentryanjohnson.com/assets/images/dogs/say-what.gif",
  "This is Piglet. She's a rescue American Pit Bull Terrier hailing from the Central Valley of California, now living mostly in an orange chair in SF. She loves sitting on people, booping things with her nose, and disguising herself as a land seal. Her person is Christa. https://gsa.enterprise.slack.com/files/U02DT2TJMA7/F02FJS98PJT/pig.png"
